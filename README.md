# EmployeeTracker
### This is an application that allows a company to keep track of their employees' info.


### This application utilizes MySQL and node.js, with dependency on inquirer, in order to collect employee info and store it in a database to be retrieved later. Once the information has been stored it can be a called to be displayed in the console. Some actions that can be taken in the console are:

    * Add
        * Employee
        * Department
        * Role
    *View
        * Departments
        * Employees
        * Roles
        * Employees by Manager
        * Total Budget of each Department
    * Update Employees
         * Roles
         * Managers
    * Delete Employees
    
### The actions taken in the console are reflected in the MySQL database so that the information can be accessed at a later time. As this application cannot be deployed, I have included a link to a screen recording showing its functionality.
